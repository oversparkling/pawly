# Pawly

Pawly is an app that was ideated by Nicholas (oversparkling) and Chiara (cclimcl) as a side project to provide an all-in-one tracker for your pet, from their daily tasks to important details like their vaccination documents, grooming history etc.

### Technology Stack

For this project we implemented the use of React-Native as our primary frontend technology with CSS and some tailwind implementation

Additionally, we used NodeJS for our backend as well as Firestore as our database due to the flexibility of NoSQL. We also utilised Firebase Storage system to 
host our images for our pet profile feature. 

### Demo of our application

Much like a to-do app, Pawly hopes to provide a pleasant user experience for tracking daily tasks for their pets. Additionally, upon tasks completion, users
can also choose to delete the tasks

Additionally, we also introduced a feature for users to upload their pet pictures so as to share with others!

Lastly, in this Add Pets screen, we can see how each user can input many details of their pets, enhancing the all in one functionality that we envisioned for
our application.
